# TMA-Botnet-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
Educational project for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis

Implementation a 1DCNN to be trained using the CTU-13 dataset, which is a collection of different scenarios where different botnets were generating traffic. 

Steps:

1) Install Python 3.10 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/ *REMEMBER to add python 3.10 to the path*
  2) Go to 1DCNN_v01.00 -> Scripts -> and execute in the terminal "activate". Once this will be completed, you will be working in a virtual environment.
  3) Return to the \TMA-Botnet-Detection-with-Deep-Learning\1DCNN Code and execute in the command line: "jupyter notebook"
  4) Wait. Then a browser web page will open, and shows the jupyter environment. Select "New" at the top right of the window, and select "1DCNN_v01.00" as Kernel.

Let's code!
